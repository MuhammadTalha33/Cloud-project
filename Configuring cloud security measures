# Task 3: Configuring Cloud Security Measures

## Objective
Enhance cloud infrastructure security by implementing best practices and ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations.

## Key Security Measures Implemented

### 1. **Identity and Access Management (IAM) Configuration**
   - **Objective**: Ensure secure access to cloud resources.
   - **Actions**:
     - Implemented IAM roles to grant permissions based on the principle of least privilege.
     - Configured multi-factor authentication (MFA) for users accessing critical resources.
     - Set up fine-grained policies to control access to specific resources.

### 2. **Firewall and Security Groups Setup**
   - **Objective**: Protect cloud resources from unauthorized network access.
   - **Actions**:
     - Created security groups to define inbound and outbound traffic rules.
     - Configured network access control lists (ACLs) to manage traffic at the subnet level.
     - Restricted access to sensitive resources based on IP address, ensuring that only authorized users can connect.

### 3. **Encryption for Data at Rest and in Transit**
   - **Objective**: Safeguard sensitive data from unauthorized access or interception.
   - **Actions**:
     - Enabled encryption for all data stored (at rest) using industry-standard algorithms.
     - Configured SSL/TLS protocols for secure data transfer (in transit) between client and server.

### 4. **Monitoring Security Logs and Alerts**
   - **Objective**: Maintain real-time visibility into security events and threats.
   - **Actions**:
     - Enabled logging for key cloud services to track access and modification events.
     - Configured alerts to notify administrators of suspicious activity or policy violations.
     - Integrated monitoring tools (such as AWS CloudWatch or Azure Monitor) to track security events and respond quickly.

### 5. **Regular Security Audits and Assessments**
   - **Objective**: Ensure ongoing compliance with security policies and industry standards.
   - **Actions**:
     - Scheduled regular audits to review IAM roles, permissions, and access policies.
     - Performed security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
     - Implemented remediation measures for any discovered security gaps.

## Conclusion
By configuring these security measures, the cloud infrastructure is better protected against unauthorized access and threats. Continuous monitoring and regular security assessments ensure ongoing security compliance and help mitigate potential risks.
