Cloud Computing Assignment: VM Deployment

Project Overview

This project involves deploying a virtual machine (VM) on the cloud by performing the following tasks:

Setting up a Virtual Network and Subnets

Installing and Configuring Necessary Software

Ensuring Security through Firewall and Access Control

Monitoring and Optimizing VM Performance

Technologies Used

Cloud Provider: [ AWS]


Network: Virtual Network, Subnets, Network Security Groups (NSGs), Firewalls

Steps Followed

1. Virtual Network and Subnets

Created a virtual network with subnets to isolate and segment network traffic.

Subnet configurations for communication between internal and external resources were implemented.

2. Installing and Configuring Software

Installed necessary software such as [MySQL] on the VM.

Configured services to ensure that they start automatically on boot and can be accessed securely.

3. Security Configuration

Set up firewall rules to allow/deny specific traffic based on IP ranges and protocols.

Configured access control policies using [IAM Roles/Security Groups/etc.].

Ensured the use of SSH keys for secure remote access to the VM.

4. Monitoring and Optimizing VM Performance

Enabled monitoring of CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, and network traffic.

Set up alerts for unusual activity or resource bottlenecks.

Optimized resource allocation to ensure efficient performance under expected loads.
