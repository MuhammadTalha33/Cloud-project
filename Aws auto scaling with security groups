 AWS Auto Scaling with Security Groups

#### **Objective**
Create an AWS instance using the auto-scaling method that automatically adjusts the number of instances based on network load, ensuring secure communication and access control through security groups.

---

#### **1. Auto Scaling Setup**

- **Step 1**: Log in to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
  
- **Step 2**: Navigate to **EC2 Dashboard** > **Auto Scaling**.

- **Step 3**: Click **Create Auto Scaling Group**.

- **Step 4**: Choose a **Launch Template** or **Launch Configuration**. If you donâ€™t have one:
  - Click **Create launch configuration**.
  - Choose the instance type (e.g., t2.micro).
  - Configure details such as storage, key pairs, and security groups (discussed in Step 3 below).
  - Finalize and name your launch configuration.

- **Step 5**: Set up scaling policies based on network load:
  - Under "Scaling policies," choose **Target Tracking**.
  - Set the target CPU utilization to a threshold (e.g., 70%).
  - This ensures that when the load goes above this threshold, instances will automatically be added, and when it decreases, instances will be removed.

#### **2. Security Groups Setup**

- **Step 1**: While creating your Auto Scaling group, under the **Security Groups** section, create or choose an existing security group.

- **Step 2**: Ensure that the security group allows:
  - **Inbound traffic**: HTTP (port 80), HTTPS (port 443), and SSH (port 22) from trusted IP ranges.
  - **Outbound traffic**: Open to all for outbound requests.
  
- **Step 3**: Ensure proper **access control** to allow secure communication between instances and any databases or services they need to interact with.

#### **3. Testing and Monitoring**

- **Step 1**: After setting up the Auto Scaling group, increase load on the system by generating traffic or using a load-testing tool (like Apache JMeter or AWS CloudWatch).

- **Step 2**: Monitor the scaling behavior in **EC2 > Auto Scaling** to ensure additional instances are launched when the load increases and terminated when it decreases.

- **Step 3**: Review security group rules in the **EC2 Dashboard** to confirm secure access.
